# DynaSFX

DynaSFX is a fully offline Flutter music player. It is designed to allow users to play Dynamic Soundtracks (Songs that change based on what is happening on screen), divinding the different sections of the song into custom loops, defining how the should switch from one to the others and even allowing the user to play custom sound effects over the song.

## Why develop this?

As a Dungeons & Dragons DM, I find it very useful to have music in the background while playing: it really can be the difference between an OK game and an awesome one. The problem is that often songs have multiple parts and not all of them are appropriate to the scene that is happening. Other times, usually with boss fights, I would really like to use dynamic soundtracks the way they are meant to be used, but the looping function in other audio player or Youtube simply don't allow for that. This is my solution to the problem.

## On what platforms will it run?

Once I release the application, it will be designed to work on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Be weary that, since I use a Windows machine and don't own any Macs, the program will only be tested for the first two platforms. If there are problems with the MacOS build (or any other build), just post them in the Issues section.

## When will it release?

I do this only as an hobby, so don't expect regular updates. I will release it once it is ready, or at least once it doesn't crash your computer when you try to run it.
